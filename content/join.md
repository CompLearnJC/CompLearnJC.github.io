<!-- ## 🔬 Open Research Position: Visual Compositional Generation

We are excited to announce an open research opportunity under **Dr. Rohban** at the **RIML Lab, Sharif University of Technology**. This project focuses on enhancing **text-to-image (T2I) generation** in diffusion-based models by addressing **compositional challenges**.


### 🔍 Project Overview:

While large-scale diffusion models have made significant progress in **T2I synthesis**, they still struggle with challenges such as **object omission** and **misaligned attribute binding**. This research aims to address these **compositional failures** to enhance the **quality and accuracy** of T2I models.
