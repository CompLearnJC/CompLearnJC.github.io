      <description>Overview Compositional learning, inspired by the innate human ability to break down and generate complex ideas from simpler building blocks, seeks to empower machines with similar capacities. By recombining learned components, this approach significantly enhances generalization, allowing models to handle out-of-distribution (OOD) samples in real-world scenarios. This promising capability has sparked a surge of interest in several fields, including:
üîç Object-centric learning ‚Äì enabling models to recognize and manipulate individual objects in complex environments.</description>
