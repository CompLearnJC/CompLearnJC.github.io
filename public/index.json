At test time, either the ensemble agrees on an action, and we generalize well, or we take exploratory actions with the help of maximum entropy agent and drive us to a novel part of the state space, where the ensemble may potentially agree again. This method combined with an invariance based approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on ProcGen.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/posts/compositional-visual-generation-with-composable-diffusion-models/","summary":"Abstract This paper studies the problem of zero-shot generalization in reinforcement learning and introduces an algorithm that trains an ensamble of maximum reward seeking agents and an maximum entropy agent.
